### Work Out

I had a tough time building my body. I spent one year losing 70 lbs (from 230 to 160) through jogging and diet, then gained around 20 lbs muscle by lift weighting. Thus I'm good at working out in the gym for both aerobic and anaerobic exercise. Sadly I can't go to the gym during coronavirus, I'm learning more about indoor fitness like power yoga. Welcome anyone who wants to build his body or learn together to contact me!


### Cooking

I started cooking by myself when I was studying in Hong Kong. Most of the time I cook healthy food to keep fit, while I do cook and eat a lot for cheat meals (sometimes 7 days a week)! I like traditional Chinese food, Mexican and burgers since I'm so obsessed with beef.
