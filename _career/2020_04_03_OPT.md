[Geoffrey Hung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geoffreyhung/) and I wrote an article, published on medium about how best to fill out your OPT form. This article is primarily aimed at graduate students on F1 visas who are filling out I-765 forms. The article includes estimates of when forms may be processed by USICS based on historical data.
