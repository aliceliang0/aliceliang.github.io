Alternative Title: Dogs' missing rate by breed

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/lost_dog.jpg" width="250" /></div>

The purpose of this project is to compute the missing rate of different dog's breeds with [DataWorld Animal Center Intake](https://data.world/nickgott/austin-2011-animal-intake). We tried to summarize the common features of breeds that are easy to lost.

Note: We used ggplot in Python to do the visualization.

This project is a lot fun! After studying a bunch of reasons such as size, age, running speed, we found that the key feature that significantly increases the missing rate of dog is: sterilization, i.e. whether the owner spays it or not. For different breeds, male or female dogs also have huge difference. For example, male huskies have much higher missing rate while female corgis are easier to get lost, from our data.
