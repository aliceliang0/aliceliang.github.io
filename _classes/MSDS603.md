This course is co-taught with [Diane Woodbridge](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/diane-woodbridge) and has two major, interconnected components. Students learn about the business strategy behind how companies use data by building their own application. Each team comes up with a data-focused business and then are required to build it over seven weeks. At the conclusion of the course, a panel of venture capitalists come in and critique the cream of the applications.
